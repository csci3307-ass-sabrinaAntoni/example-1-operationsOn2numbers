# example-1-operationsOn2numbers
Example Java project created via STS as Java Project, that does some basic math operations on 2 numbers, showing how to;
- doing without any OOP or polymorphism - simple package,
- doing with OOP and polymorphism - oop package,
- create main entry classes (MainEntry4simple, MainEntry4oop),
- create interfaces (Has2numbers, oop.Multiply), 
- create abstract base class (OperatorFor2numbers) that contain some common attribute and methods that implement an interface (Has2numbers),
- create child class (MultiplyOperatorFor2numbers) that extend an abstract base (OperatorFor2numbers) and implement an interface (oop.Multiply)
- polymorphism, users of implementations of an interface to view them via interface (MainEntry4oop.main)
- using ObjectAid UML plugin to create dynamic(diagram will auto update when you change a class in it) UML diagrams (class diagram)
